# Mall Customer Segmentation Prediction
## Oveview
This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their annual income and spending behavior using unsupervised machine learning techniques, including K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering. The analysis provides actionable insights to inform business strategies such as targeted marketing and personalized offers.

## Project Step
1.Data Loading and Exploration

Dataset: Mall Customer Segmentation dataset.
Features: Annual Income, Spending Score, Gender, Age.
Objective: Understand customer spending patterns.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized income and spending relationships.
Identified potential clusters through scatter plots.

3.Data Preprocessing

Scaled features using StandardScaler for consistency.
Encoded categorical variables if needed.

4.K-Means Clustering

Optimal clusters determined using Elbow Method (K=5).
Clear and efficient segmentation for distinct customer groups.

5.Hierarchical Clustering

Dendrograms used to identify clusters.
Highlighted overlaps and hierarchical relationships.

6.Model Comparison

Compared K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.
K-Means provided faster and simpler results; Hierarchical revealed subtle patterns.
